# Machine Learning Projects And Financial Modelling

### Before staring with financial modelling, it is important to know theory behind financial modelling.

#### What is a stock?
- To put it simply, a stock (or equities) is a single share of a company. 
- Stock price fluctuates every second.
- You can purchase multiple or single shares of a stock, but cannot buy fractional shares.

#### Multual Funds and ETF's
- A mutual fund is a portfolio made up of many different stocks.
- Traded once a day (or by the prospectus):
    - Equity
    - Fixed Income
    - Balanced
- ETFs are also a portfolio of stocks but traded all day instead of once a day.

#### Why are stocks and funds so important?
- Stocks allow companies to build capital withoutborrowing from banks.
- Companies determine how many shares of the company they release.
- Promotes investments and company growth.

### Machine Learning can help with financial modelling and predictions

#### What is machine learning?
- Machine learning is a way for computers to learn from experience.
    - Models have training data which is used to help the computer learn how to deal with data.
    - ML can be supervised or unsupervised.
    
#### Supervised Vs Unsupervised Learning
- Groups data based on input data, but not output data (no output data is given).
- Helps develop predictive models based on both input and output data.

#### Algotithms
- Machine learning has many different algorithms but the two explored in this study were Kmeans clustering and Principle Component Analysis (PCA).

##### What is Kmeans?
- Specifically, kmeans uses vector quantization to cluster data. To put in simple terms, the computer calculates vector components based on center points and aims to group data based on similar vector values. 
    - You can use Kmeans clustering when working work numerical or categorical data, but the data must be converted.
- Kmeans is an unsupervised ML algorithm as it uses only input data to cluster.
    
##### What is PCA?
- PCA aims to decrease the number of dimensions in a given data set by projecting the data onto specific subspaces. 
    - While these projections do lose some information, it helps speed up computational time.
- PCA is a supervised learning method that uses both input and output data.
